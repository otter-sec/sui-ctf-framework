# Interactive Challenge Example

This example demonstrates an interactive CTF challenge using the sui-ctf-framework with a menu-based interface.

## Running the Challenge

1. Start the server:
```bash
./run_server.sh
```

2. In another terminal, start the client:
```bash
./run_client.sh
```

The client will connect to the server and present an interactive menu for solving the challenge.
